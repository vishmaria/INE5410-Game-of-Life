/*
 * The Game of Life
 *
 * RULES:
 *  1. A cell is born, if it has exactly three neighbours.
 *  2. A cell dies of loneliness, if it has less than two neighbours.
 *  3. A cell dies of overcrowding, if it has more than three neighbours.
 *  4. A cell survives to the next generation, if it does not die of lonelines or overcrowding.
 *
 * In this version, a 2D array of ints is used.  A 1 cell is on, a 0 cell is off.
 * The game plays a number of steps (given by the input), printing to the screen each time.
 * A 'x' printed means on, space means off.
